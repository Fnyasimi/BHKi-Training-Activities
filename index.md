The Bioinformatics Hub of Kenya Intiative ([BHKi](https://bhki.org/)) is organizing a three day hybrid (in-person and virtual) seminar series event, scheduled in **June 14 - 16 2022**. 

### BHKi Seminars: Bioinformatics, software engineering and Data Management

The goal of this seminar series  is to create an opportunity to expose or introduce our community to open science, bioinformatics and software research. The event will enhance networking and collaboration among our diverse community and other communities. Our target audience is bioinfromatics students and researchers who are working on their projects and need exposure to bioinformatics, open science and software research skills. 

Below is a three-day program of the hybrid event.

**Day 1 :** Project Planning and Data Managment
The introdction will comprise of talks about project planning, with a look into coming up with a project plan from conceptualization to analysis to communication, and a guide on “how” to stick to the plan, or how to deal with changes to the plan. A second talk on data management practices for projects, understanding the data types and appropriate tools to use, data organization and clean up - involving how to name your files and preprocessing your data in a reproducible way.  

The afternoon practical sessions will introduce available open source project planning tools (or templates) e.g. Github projects, and agile. This will be followed by data management methods and a practical session on available tools for data management.

**Day 2 :**  Omics - Genomics, Proteomics, Transcriptomics and metabolomics groups 
Participants will be grouped into four major omics topics covered in different rooms physically and breakout rooms virtually. These four topics i.e genomic, proteomics, transcriptomics and metabolomics, overlap with participants' interests and projects. The goal is to introduce participants to these fields, train on major bioinformatics analyses, and presentation of results to different audiences in a parallel manner. Three seminars will be offered this day, for example, in the genomics room/breakout room: a talk on plant genomics, animal genomics and aquatic genomics will be presented to target a diverse audience, followed by an open dialogue on a topic such as the currents trends in genomics and its applications. 
Afternoon sessions: All participants will be introduced to reporting scientific findings - how to write a manuscript and publishing in open journals, communicating your science through presentation - talks, poster presentations, speed talks etc

**Day 3:** Research software 
Research software engineering talks will be held to expose or to enlighten our community on this career path. This field is rarely talked about in our community, with minimal exposure to research software skills and FAIR principles on software research. The ultimate goal is to create a space for collaborations with skilled research software individuals/groups within our community. This will lead to the growth of existing research software engineers within our community and expanding their networks through these kind of events.
