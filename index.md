## Welcome to Bioinformatics Hub of Kenya Intiative Open Bioinformatics Fund (OBF) event 

The Open Bioinformatics Foundation ([OBF](https://www.open-bio.org)) promotes open source bioinformatics software development and open science in the biological research community. 
The OBF Event Fellowship program is aimed at increasing diverse participation at events promoting open science practices such as open source software and resource development in the bioinformatics and biological research community.

The Bioinformatics Hub of Kenya Intiative (BHKi)(https://bhki.org/) in partnership with OBF organises a three day hybrid (in-person and virtual) event, scheduled in June 14 - 16 2022. 


### Bioinformatics research journey condensed: Ideation to completion

The goal of this event is to create and opportunity to expose or introduce our community to open science, bioinformatics and software research. 

_more details added_




Below is a three-day program of the hybrid event

**Day 1 :** Project Planning and Data Managment
Talks about coming up with a project plan from writing to analysis to communication, and “how” to stick to the plan, or how to deal with changes to the plan. How to practice data management practices for our projects. Understanding the data type and appropriate tools to use. Data organization and clean up - involving how to name your files and preprocessing your data in a reproducible way. 

Afternoon practical sessions for available tools to plan your project (or templates) e.g. Github projects, agile and data management methods 


| **Talk** | **Speaker** |

|Project plan – part one: <br/>Deciding on a project goal | Speaker TBC |
|Project plan - part two: <br/>Developing goals and objectics | Speaker TBC|
|Data Management planning | Speaker TBC|
|FAIR data| Speker TBC|
|Lunch Break|
|Practical sessions 1 – available tools to plan your project e.g. GitHub, agile etc <br/> Practical sessions 2 – available tools for data organization and clean up involving how to name your files, preprocessing your data in a reproducible way|


**Day 2 :**  Omics - Genomics, Proteomics, Transcriptomics and metabolomics groups 
Participants will be grouped into four major omics topics covered in different rooms physically or breakout rooms online. These four topics are genomic, proteomics, Transcriptomics and metabolomics. These groups are based on participants' interests. The goal is to introduce participants to these fields, understand what are major analyses in bioinformatics, and how to present results in sort of a seminar series. This will happen concurrently in the four groups. Three seminars will be offered this day, for example, in the genomics room/break out room: a talk on plant genomics, animal genomics and aquatic genomics will be presented to target a wider audience and not be biased followed by an open dialogue on the currents trends in geneomics for example. 
Afternoon sessions: All participants will be introduced to reporting scientific findings - how to write a manuscript and publishing in open journals, communicating your science through presentation - talks, poster presentations, speed talks etc

|communicating your science | Speaker TBC |
|Student - Supervisor relationship - Mental health in research| Speaker TBC|


**Day 3:** Research software 
Research software engineering talks will expose or create an opportunity to enlighten our community on the career path. This field is untapped in our community, with minimal exposure to research software skills and FAIR principles on software research. The ultimate goal is to create a space for start-up collaborations with established software research groups within our community. Also, the already existing software engineers within our community grow and expand their networks through these talks and open dialogues.
